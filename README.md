# Zeebee

My Google Clone (aka Zeebee is what I call it, because Google was already taken lolol) is a full-stack search engine that's built from:

- JavaScript as the client-side language
- jQuery as a JavaScript framework
- PHP for backend scripting and object-oriented design
- MySQL for the database

Software needed for development:

- Text Editor (Visual Studio Code was the one used for this project)
- XAMPP (Click the link to install: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- Icons8 for the icons and logo used in this application (Click here to install: https://icons8.com/)
